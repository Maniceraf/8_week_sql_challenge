# 8 Week SQL Challenge
Case study questions and answers/solutions for [#8WeekSQLChallenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/ "8 Week SQL Challenge") by [Danny Ma](https://www.datawithdanny.com/ "Data With Danny")

This repository contains all of my SQL submissions for the [#8WeekSQLChallenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/ "8 Week SQL Challenge") created by [Danny Ma](https://www.datawithdanny.com/ "Data With Danny").

In the summer of 2022 I completed Danny's Challenge and I found it to be the best SQL exercises out there.  However, these challenges were challenging, many times I had to review other peoples work to figure out how to exactly get the correct answers.

This year I decided to revisit the challenge to brush up on my SQL and to fix errors, finish incomplete and refactor some of my SQL code as I have more efficient methods of getting the correct answer.  I will attempt to comment the code as to help others who may be struggling with some of the questions.

I would also like to acknowledge of GitHub repo's that were essential in helping learn to how appoach the problems.
